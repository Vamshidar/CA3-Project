          <h1> SAP </h1>
          <h2> Overview: </h2> 
          <p> SAP is the heartbeat of the global economy. SAP R/3 is an ERP software package implementation designed to coordinate all the key elements required to complete the business process. SAP designed into different functional modules covering the typical functions of an organization.
          </p>
          <h2> The most widely used functional modules are: </h2>
          <p>
            Sales and Distribution<br>
            Finance and Controls<br>
            Material Management<br>
            Production Planning<br>
            Plant maintenance<br>
            Human Resource<br>

            Testing the functionality of the application in front end (GUI), working as expected with the newly updated configuration. Don't want to find an issue in production after you make the changes, consequently regression testing in a QA environment SAP environment undergoes continual change - patches and fixes, new module implementations and configuration changes. This creates an ongoing need for regression testing with some SAP environments having more than 2000 regression test cases. SAP TAO: SAP has designed a specific tool for automation, Test Accelerating and Optimization tool which streamlines the creation and maintenance of business components. Using TAO, it maximizes the testing deployment by reducing the time required to build or execute the scripts.

          <h2> Software Testing: </h2>
          <p>Software testing is a systematic activity which identifies defects in the software and helps in correcting and preventing them before the software is released to the end user. <br>

 

          In a world of increasing dependence on Software, Improper functioning of software can lead to serious circumstances such as injuries or death (aero plane software failures may lead to fatalities), loss of time (slow processing), loss of money etc.<br>

 

         Testing of Software has become one of the fastest growing areas of corporate IT expenditure.<br>

 

        According to Pierre Audoin Consultants (PAC)Testing has become one of the fastest growing areas of corporate IT expenditure& worldwide spending on testing (including both internal and external testing skills, tools and related hardware and systems) will reach approximately €79bn in 2010, and will nearly hit the €100bn mark by 2014 meaning enormous growth in opportunities for Software Testers<br>
          </p>  

          <h2>Software testing opportunities </h2>
          <p>With so many sectors leveraging Information Technology to simplify, improve and innovate business processes in their respective fields (Oil & Exploration, Telecom, Health Care, Air Travel etc....) the potential for software development is immense. For each project, a team of testing professionals is a must. Different projects carry different ratio of Development personnel to Testing personnel but the industry practice is 3:<br>
          1. Meaning for every 3 developers there must be one test engineer to successfully implement software.<br>

 

        Software testing as a career is a sunshine career, i.e., it is just about to take off with a huge potential in near future.<br>

 

        Any graduate with qualified training on Software Testing can aspire for a career in software testing. Most of the companies recruit from the following qualifications, B.Sc, B.Com, BCA, B.Tech, MCA, M.Sc, M.Techetc.
